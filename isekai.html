            <h1>Basic Agriculture</h1>
            <p>
              Around fifteen thousand years, humans began to transition to a
              more sedentary lifesstyle. More food than someone could carry
              would be stored in one location rather than constantly migrating
              in search of new food. As these societies became more rooted,
              agriculture would develop. Cultivating your own plants allows for
              a certain area of land to produce more human accessible calories,
              at a cost of increased labor requirements. Societies that engaged
              in this more directed and sedentary cultivation were able to feed
              more people in a given space, an advantage they could use to
              displace other groups as they expand. A combination of this
              displacement and knowledge transfer, along with some indepedendent
              invention would lead to agriculture becoming the dominant mode of
              production for the majority of humans.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's start with a simple model, the amount of food produced in a
              given amount of land (a square kilometer along a river bank for
              this example) is dependent on the amount of labor put into it.
              When there are 0 households on this land, no food is being
              produced for human consumption. When there is one, they are
              operating at densities about double the normal hunter gatherer
              band. They might be engaging in a low density form of pastioralism
              (raising livestock), they might cultivate a smaller proportion of
              the land agriculturally or some combination fo the two. With
              densities this low, most of the land will run wild whether woods,
              a wetland or a heath.
            </p>
            <p>
              A medieval peasant would like to be connected to other people,
              especially ones able to provide metal tools, the ability to store
              food and religious services. Thus they would rather live closer to
              centers of population, but if it were close enough to a center of
              population, they might take root but wish for a shorter walk. If
              given the proper tools for the environment, they would be able to
              produce much more than enough food for themselves most years. This
              would lead to population growth as households split as sons and
              daughters marry off with other families and new households move in
              to the empty land (if land is a constraint in nearby places).
            </p>
            <p>
              A generation or two passes and now there are three households on
              the land. There is still plenty to go around and productive
              portions are still being left alone. They continue to be able to
              produce more than enough food for themselves, but every so often
              harvests will be small and a year of hunger would occur. The
              amount of labor required to feed a family remains light.
            </p>
            <p>
              More generations pass and now there are five households leaving
              above 50 acres/20 hectares per family. Almost all the land has
              been put to some productive use
