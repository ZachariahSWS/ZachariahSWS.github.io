# About Me

I'm a Freshman at the University of California, Santa Cruz in Applied Mathematics. I like math ), computer science, history and politics (especially the nitty gritty of policy). In my free time I work on this website, graphics programming, read books, write an alternate history timeline about an early recovery from the Great Depression, go on walks and hang out on twitter.

### Want to hire me?

- I'll show up to a meeting somewhere in the Bay Area for free (as long as the meeting is interesting!)
- Email me to discuss compensation for a job
