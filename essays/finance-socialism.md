## Taxation

Why not crank taxes up as high as they go? When you tax something, you get less of it.

Here's a basic supply and demand graph, quantity is on the x-axis and price is on the y-axis.

Now look what happens when we introduce a tax.

There's now less goods being produced. If you tax the number of windows in a home, people will build homes with less windows. The government is making less money than they expected and people are now living a worse life because of the missing windows.

Economists classify the value of positive sum trades which are prevented as deadweight loss.

$$DWL = \frac12 \times t^2 \times P \times Q \times (\varepsilon_s + \varepsilon_d)$$

Note that $P$ and $Q$ are the initial price and quantity and are thus fixed. Similarly $\varepsilon_s$ and $\varepsilon_d$ are the marginal elasticity of supply and demand and are similarly fixed (kind of). Thus we can see that deadweight loss is proportional to the square of the tax rate $t$.

Now let's look at what happens with land (in the economic sense). No matter how expensive a license to use a certain portion of radio frequencies is, there will not be new radio frequencies to use.

And when a tax is implemented, there's no deadweight loss.

A similar story plays out with physical plots of land (though there is very minor supply elasticity with land reclamation). No matter how much you tax the value of the physical land, you will have no economic inefficiency until people begin to abandon land due to equilibrium price going negative.
