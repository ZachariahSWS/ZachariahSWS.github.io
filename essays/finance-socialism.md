## Taxation

Why not crank taxes up as high as they go? When you tax something, you get less of it.

If you tax the number of windows in a home, people will build homes with less windows. The government is making less money than they expected and people are now living a worse life because of the missing windows.

Economists classify the value of positive sum trades which are prevented as deadweight loss.

$$DWL = \frac12 \times t^2 \times P \times Q \times (\varepsilon_s + \varepsilon_d)$$

Note that $P$ and $Q$ are the initial price and quantity and are thus fixed. Similarly $\varepsilon_s$ and $\varepsilon_d$ are the marginal elasticity of supply and demand and are similarly fixed (kind of). Thus we can see that deadweight loss is proportional to the square of the tax rate $t$.
