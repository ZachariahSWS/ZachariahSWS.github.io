Many people have a complicated relationship with the internet, I don't. I like it, a lot. Short form video content makes me feel disgusted and the main doomscrolling I do is text based (twitter).

Never one to passively consume, I dive into the arena and voice my opinions and get others in return. Everyone has their battles, and mine are with random people online. Does Sydney have artificially high home values? Yeah, maybe. Is Kamala Harris' unrealized capital gains tax bad policy? No, it's an improvement on the status quo. Does literature for 12 year olds deal with themes of rape? Yes, To Kill a Mockingbird does. Are deficits responsible for recent economic growth? No, they've been crowding out private investment. In the war of ideas, I am a medieval aristocrat.

I am a competitive person by nature
