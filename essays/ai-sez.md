On November 19th, 2024 the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission released its yearly report which called for "Congress \[to\] establish and fund a Manhattan Project-like program dedicated to racing to and acquiring an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) capability". In the spirit of that reccomendation, here's a bill to expand datacenter and relevant manufacturing facilties through the create of AI special economic zones.
