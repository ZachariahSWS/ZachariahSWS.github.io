On November 19th, 2024 the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission released its yearly report which called for "Congress \[to\] establish and fund a Manhattan Project-like program dedicated to racing to and acquiring an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) capability". In the spirit of that reccomendation, here's a bill to expand datacenter and relevant manufacturing facilties through the create of AI special economic zones.

# A BILL
To establish Special Economic Zones for Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Development and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

## SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

a. FINDINGS.—Congress finds that:
  1. The development of artificial intelligence capabilities is fundamental to the national security and economic competitiveness of the United States;
  2. The United States faces significant strategic competition in artificial intelligence development from foreign powers;
  3. The computational infrastructure required for artificial intelligence development represents a critical national capability;
  4. Advanced semiconductor manufacturing is essential to national security and represents a strategic vulnerability given current geographic concentration of production capacity;
  5. The United States must rapidly develop domestic semiconductor manufacturing capabilities to ensure supply chain security for critical AI infrastructure;
  6. Current regulatory and permitting processes impede the rapid development of necessary artificial intelligence infrastructure and semiconductor manufacturing facilities; and
  7. The creation of dedicated zones for accelerated infrastructure development will enhance national security and maintain U.S. technological leadership.
b. PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to:
  1. Accelerate the development of artificial intelligence infrastructure and semiconductor manufacturing capacity in the United States;
