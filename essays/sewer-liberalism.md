## Good Outcomes Improve Vibes

It is no secret that liberal states like California and New York are growing much slower than conservative ones like Texas and Florida. California's population grew from 34.0 million in 2000 to 39.0 in 2023 (39.5 in 2020 if you only trust censuses). Texas by contrast has grown from 20.9 to 30.5 million (29.2 in 2020) in 2023. That means every year California was growing by 0.60% each year compared to 1.65% in Texas. The next biggest states, New York and Florida have grown 0.12% and 1.51% annualized respectively.

This presents a fairly good argument for conservatives: if liberalism is so good why doesn't anyone vote with their feet? With New York, Illinois and Massachusetts a weather based argument is possible but California's climate is famously desireable. Thus the liberal must acknowledge that they have bad housing policies or leave the challenge unanswered. Either is obviously suboptimal, it would be a lot easier if liberal states were growing just as fast if not faster.

[Matt Yglesias](https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/1855274605453156862){: .external-link} made the point that "\[i\]t would not be that hard to turn California, New York, Massachusetts, and Maryland into the fastest-growing states in America and if that was the situation I think perceptions of Democrats would meaningfully change". People can see what governance looks like when liberals are in charge of a polity, and it's not obviously better. This essay will thus give suggestions for policies that are good on the merits and achievable in subnational governments in order to generate broad prosperity and make liberalism more appealing to the american electorate. What I will not do is give advice to people trying to win moderate electorates, what generates good outcomes is not always the same as what is advantageous to run on.

Milwaukee was the most socialist city in America at the turn of the 20th century. Despite lack of widespread support across america, local elections could be won by various parties from Union-Labor in 1886 to the Socialist Party of America in the 1900s. They expressed a form of pragmatic socialism focused on delivering useful institutions which measurably improved people's lives, like the municipal sewer which they would brag about to no end.

It is now time for liberalism to create its own accomplishments liberals can proudly brag about.

## Infrastructure

See my article on [High-Speed Rail](/essays/high-speed-rail){: .internal-link} if you'd like to see a national take on railroads but this section will be focused on the state level.

An underdiscussed problem in american government is the crisis of highway costs. Since 2003, consumer prices have risen 1.71x, private capital goods 1.64x and highways 3.24x. Adjusting for inflation (CPI), highways are thus 1.89x more expensive to build. Part of this is the high cost of asphalt (very volatile but 3.07x higher than January 2003 as of September 2024) but savings can be made by switching from the current prevailing wage system to actual market wages. Freeing up money currently spent on highway construction allows for either more generous spending or a reduction in taxes.

Subway construction in New York is extraordinarily inefficient, at around 10x the price (PPP adjusted) per kilometer of international best practices and 5x of what can realistically be achieved. The appointment of and most critically political support thrown behind an MTA Construction and Development President who is willing to say no to the endless demands of interest groups will allow for projects like the second avenue subway to not be [embarassingly expensive](https://www.masstransitmag.com/rail/infrastructure/blog/55131921/op-ed-august-mta-77-billion-second-avenue-subway-phase-2-status-update){: .external-link}.

Currently, stations are made significantly larger than they need to be, with most of the excess space not even open to the public but instead providing underground offices and breakrooms for various different organizations. These rooms are both made larger than they need to be and are constructed underground, where costs are significantly higher. The second avenue subway spent &dollar;300 million alone on agreements with various permit issuers such as "a &dollar;15 million deal the MTA made with NYC Parks in 2004 to temporarily stage construction at the Marx Brothers Playground on Second Avenue between 96th and 97th Streets" ([Transit Costs Project](https://transitcosts.com/wp-content/uploads/NewYork_Case_Study.pdf){: .external-link}). Political pressure should be put on these organizations to simply give permits that the duly elected legislature has obviously approved of. These deals alone were almost 10% (perhaps more if you count contractor delays) of the cost of the project, able to be evaporated at will by a willing government.

The NYC department of Environmental Protection delayed approval of a pipe relocation for 6 months and required an unneeded redesign which led to a 9 month total increase in time and 20% extra cost for that particular contract. These kinds of issues lead to MTA plans sending stations and tunnels as deep as possible to avoid utilities, which further increases price and worsens user experience of the final product. In the current system where departments go unpunished for the harm they cause, they will continue to ignore tradeoffs.

Union sandhogs certainly get paid more than market wages, but the more damaging is the excessive personnel required by contract. New York should seek to make a grand bargain where each segment requires fewer workers in exchange for promises of increased total contracts due to the MTA's capital budget now going further (mostly at the cost of nonlaborer contractors).

Other jurisdictions like Los Angeles have similar problems, but not to quite the same scale as New York. They will all benefit from a proactive governor or legislature willing to go to bat for transit construction even without extra funding.

## Housing

California's does not permit housing anymore. Despite massive prices, new permits are not issued.

## Unemployment

Less talked about is the high rates of unemployment in [California](https://www.sacbee.com/news/california/article287381510.html){: .external-link} and Illinois
