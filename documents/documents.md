description: A collection of transcribed government documents
---

This page contains government documents which are "Approved For Public Release" and thus can be freely distributed by anyone. I've formatted a lot of them as markdown which is located in the github for this website but otherwise you can read them in the rendered html. Having them as markdown files with no artifacts is useful for querying LLMs and it is easier to read than digitized images of each page.
