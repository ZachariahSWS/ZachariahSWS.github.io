                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>This constitutes a rewrite of Representative Seth Moulton(D)'s <a href = "https://moulton.house.gov/news/press-releases/moulton-delbene-introduce-american-high-speed-rail-act" class="external-link">High Speed Rail Act</a> to improve the efficacy of the bill without any increases in spending. It does this by granting the Secretary of Transportation the authority to waive all federal regulations they deem needed in the process of construction; a similar authority was granted to the Secretary of Homeland Security to construct border fencing which they <a href = "https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2023-22176.pdf" class="external-link"> recently used</a>. This rewritten bill categorically exempts these high speed rail projects from NEPA and Buy American rules and greatly limits the ability of entities to sue the projects, forcing them to file suits within 60 days and only challenge it on constitutional grounds.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, the bill now sets foreign best practices on operational high speed rail lines as standard, with deviations in terms of safety(either more stringent or less) requiring a cost benefit analysis based on the statistical value of a life. Other technocratic tweaks like changing the definition of high speed rail from 186+ MPH to 160+ MPH and increasing possible allocations to higher speed rail(100-160 MPH) have been added. Projects will also be considered based on one standard that is much harder to game: maximizing passenger miles per federal dollar spent.</p>
                    <p>Finally the bill's Transit Oriented Development section has been strengthened to apply prior waivers to it and full supercession of local regulations for DoT owned residential and commercial real estate within 2 miles. The DoT has also been granted the authority to sell 50 year leaseholds to the land it purchases charging 2% of land value a year plus some upfront sum based on highest bidder. These leaseholds come with all the prior waivers and supercession of state and local regulations to maximize development within 2 miles of the station and raise revenue to either pay for more High Speed Rail or reduce the deficit.</p>
                    <p>These changes exist to carry out the government's goals of increasing mobility, lowering carbon emissions and reducing prices/interest rates(depending on how much the fed offsets policies) in a maximally efficient manner. The failures of California High Speed Rail show how we must spend political capital on a disciplined use of best practices rather than bogging down in vetocracy. <a href = "https://hsr.ca.gov/2024/06/27/news-release-california-high-speed-rail-authority-board-clears-final-environmental-milestone-to-connect-downtown-san-francisco-to-downtown-los-angeles/" class="external-link"> Waiting 16 years on environmental review</a> is not an option if we want to be anything but a laughingstock.</p>
