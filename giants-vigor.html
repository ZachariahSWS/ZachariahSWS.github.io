                    <h2>Foreword</h2>
                    <h3>The Premise</h3>
                    <p>In Paris on May 7th, 1919, Herbert Hoover would discuss the Treaty of Versailles with his friends John Maynard Keynes and Jan Smuts. They would agree that "The economic consequences alone would pull down all Europe" if it were unaltered. In 1931, Hoover would listen to the advice of his old friend Keynes and offer a 1 year moratorium on the war debts owed the the United States.</p>
                    <p>What if Franklin Delano Roosevelt was instead the president with a personal relationship with Keynes?</p>
                    <p>This story is meant to consist of a Roosevelt administration which is able to quickly recover from the greatest economic collapse in American history. Roosevelt was under one costly delusion: that raising the price of goods and labor would cause economic recovery.</p>
                    <p>The wage increases of the blue eagle program brought an extraordinarily quick recovery in industrial production to an abrupt halt in July, 1933. In March 1933, industrial production was 52.2% lower than its all-time high of July 1929. By July 1933, it was less than 25% below the apex. The rest of the year would see a slip back to 39% below the peak. It would take until August 1935 to reach the production of July 1933.</p>
                    <p>This story hopes to keep the mid 1933 trend going until full employment is restored significantly earlier than OTL. America shall build a bridge over Okun's Gap with a metric ton of Harbeger triangles or die trying.</p>
                    <p>The 1930s were a time of enormous productivity improvements, an under-discussed fact due to the dominance of the Great Depression. In fact, that decade had the fastest total factor productivity growth of any decade in American history before or since. Rather than a time of bread lines, rampant unemployment and emergency employment, the 1930s will take their place as the golden age of progress they were meant to be.</p>

                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>I'm seeking to make a pretty quantitative economic alternate history here. As such, all of this is written in R Markdown to allow me to keep track of and manipulate data much more effectively, create graphs and tables and directly query dataframes to make sure changes are pushed everywhere. I'll add it to a new github project soon but the source code for this website is easily accessible at <a href="https://github.com/ZachariahSWS/ZachariahSWS.github.io" class="external-link">this github page</a>.</p>
                    <p>I came up with the premise of this story while reading Destructive Creation by Mark Wilson, a book about the US government's role in economic mobilization during the Second World War. The original plan was to have a US that relies more heavily on government owned and perhaps operated factories but the scope expanded. Some prominent sources that I am inspired by are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Destructive Creation by Harold Wilson which documents government owned munitions plants in WW2.</li>
                        <li>The Midas Paradox by Scott Sumner which I am using to track the 1929 and 1933 economy and as inspiration for the alternate response to the Great Depression and Recovery. However, I'm using an alternate measure of inflation than him.</li>
                        <li>In addition, I'm making use of Robert Higgs' work on hours worked by sector as a baseline to track productivity and the actual amount of labor used as it is much more accurate than unemployment rates. As the situation develops, events will drift away from OTL's depression and recovery so Sumner and Higgs' work will be used less and my alternate figures will be substituted.</li>
                        <li>I have also been making use of George Selgin's series of blog posts on the Great Depression. Sumner, Selgin and Higgs are all libertarians slant while Wilson is a defender of the public sector.</li>
                        <li>I've been relying on Adam Tooze's Wages of Destruction for an account of Nazi Germany's economy.</li>
                        <li>Finally I've been making use of US government sources like the various books hosted on hyperwar and the army green books. Other government sources include the 1930 and 1940 censuses and FRED which holds a treasure trove of data series.</li>
                    </ul></p>
                    <p>Alternate sources are welcome especially if they make heavy use of quantitative data. I encourage you to voice disagreements on plausibility or even writing style.</p>

                    <h2>Chapter 1: The Contraction</h2>
                    <h3>1929</h3>
                    <p>The New York Democratic Party had manpower problems. William Hackett was planning to run for governor but would die in 1926 after a traumatic brain injury sustained from a car crash in Cuba. The party then pushed for Edwin Corning who would also suffer health issues and decline to run. On and on it went, to Robert Wagner, George Lunn and Peter Ten Eyck who would all fail to receive enough support. Eventually, former governor and current presidential candidate Al Smith would endorse one Franklin Delano Roosevelt, fifth cousin of ex-president Theodore Roosevelt and former Assistant Secretary of the Navy. Roosevelt had given a speech in favor of Smith in 1924 and would continue to support him into 1928, which might have lead to him clinching Smith's support. He would run on a campaign of anti-corruption and be inaugurated as Governor of New York on January 1st, 1929 after winning by a narrow margin of 49 to 48%.</p>
                    <p>On March 4th, Herbert Hoover, Industrialist and Humanitarian extraordinaire would be inaugurated as the President of the United States after 8 years as the Republican Secretary of Commerce. Voters liked what they saw in their pocket books and Hoover would win in a blowout 58.2 to 40.8% against Al Smith, preserving continuous Republican rule since the end of the Great War. It was a time of hope as markets repeatedly rallied in expectation of future growth and current profits.</p>
                    <p>Following the health decline and eventual death of Benjamin Strong in October 1928, the expansionary policies of the New York Fed were reduced. Rather than trying to accommodate the overvalued pound, George Harrison was convinced there was a bubble in the stock market and the exuberance must be quashed. Harrison convinced the board to increase the discount rate from 5 to 6% on August 9th. The Bank of England would respond by reducing its discount rate but gold would rapidly drain out of the economy before they were forced to raise rates again on September 29th. August saw a 1% decline in industrial production from the July peak as market volatility increased.</p>
                    <p>Strong wasn't just responsible for the Fed's actions to prop up the Pound Sterling, he was also a major proponent of renegotiating German debts. This was more out of self interest for the United States which had loaned billions of Reichsmarks to Germany and wanted stable repayment. With his death, the cause of German debt reduction became that much weaker.</p>
                    <p>On October 28th, confidence collapsed and the Dow dropped 13% in an event known as Black Monday. The next day, the Dow declined an additional 12% bringing the aggregate down to 198. The markets could feel in their bones that something was deeply wrong in America. October's industrial production was 3.4% lower than July. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York had gotten their wish, equity prices had dropped from their earlier highs.</p>
                    <p>Across New York, folks would gossip about stock traders leaping out of skyscrapers following the precipitous falls. Despite its plausibility, suicides were rare after the crash. According to the Chief Medical Examiner of New York, Charles Norris, only 44 suicides had occurred in the month of and after the crash compared to 53 in the same period of 1928. However, suicide rates would continue to rise in response to general economic malaise, peaking in 1932, 20% higher than they were in 1929.</p>
                    <p>The New York Fed responded by dropping the discount rate back down to 5% on November 1st, wanting to accommodate the plunge without doing anything too expansionary which would repeat the "mistakes" leading to the "bubble". The markets continued to plunge, reaching half of their peak in mid-November. They lowered rates once more to 4.5% on November 15th. November's Industrial production was 8.1% lower than July.</p>
                    <p>In 1929 the US economy was 104.6 billion dollars strong with 120.4 billion hours worked across the nation. Layoffs had been rolling for the last couple months as production dropped. Avid readers of newspapers would notice the disconcerting absence of help wanted requests in between pages on stock market drops and factory closures.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h3>1930</h3>
                    <p>Despite a moderate improvement in the stock market, with the Dow reaching 267, the New York Federal Reserve reduced the discount rate to 4% on February 7th, citing continued declines in industrial production—now 12.5% below July's peak.</p>
                    <p>The Dow continued to rise, peaking at 294 in March. However, industrial production slipped further, 13.9% below its peak by that time. In response, the New York Federal Reserve cut the discount rate to 3.5% on March 14th. Further cuts followed: down to 3% on May 2nd as the Dow stabilized, but industrial production dropped to 15.9% below the previous July.</p>
                    <p>June brought another rate cut on the 20th while the Dow dropped precipitously. The Senate passed the most extreme tariff proposal in US history by a 44-42 vote on the 17th. Repayment of debt owed to the US by the UK, France, Germany and Poland all required them to export goods in order to raise dollars. In order to maintain their foreign account surpluses, they responded by raising their own trade barriers further lowering international trade. Industrial production was 18.3% under the apex and the situation would continue to slip the Fed's control.</p>
                    <p>Despite the rate cut, by December, industrial production plummeted to 30.5% below its July 1929 level, and the Dow hit a year low of 157. The New York Federal Reserve lowered its discount rate once more to 2% in an attempt to stabilize the economy.</p>
                    <p>Through the latter half of 1930, bank closures became a common story across America. According to <a href="https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/banking-panics-1930-31" class="external-link">Gary Richardson of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond</a>:</p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 25 px">Caldwell was a rapidly expanding conglomerate and the largest financial holding company in the South. It provided its clients with an array of services – banking, brokerage, insurance – through an expanding chain controlled by its parent corporation headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee. The parent got into trouble when its leaders invested too heavily in securities markets and lost substantial sums when stock prices declined. In order to cover their own losses, the leaders drained cash from the corporations that they controlled.</p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 25 px">On November 7, one of Caldwell’s principal subsidiaries, the Bank of Tennessee (Nashville) closed its doors. On November 12 and 17, Caldwell affiliates in Knoxville, Tennessee, and Louisville, Kentucky, also failed. The failures of these institutions triggered a correspondent cascade that forced scores of commercial banks to suspend operations. In communities where these banks closed, depositors panicked and withdrew funds en masse from other banks. Panic spread from town to town. Within a few weeks, hundreds of banks suspended operations. About one-third of these organizations reopened within a few months, but the majority were liquidated.</p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 25 px">Panic began to subside in early December. But on December 11, the fourth-largest bank in New York City, Bank of United States, ceased operations. The bank had been negotiating to merge with another institution. The New York Fed had helped with the search for a merger partner. When negotiations broke down, depositors rushed to withdraw funds, and New York’s superintendent of banking closed the institution. This event, like the collapse of Caldwell, generated newspaper headlines throughout the United States, stoking fears of financial panics and currency shortages like the panic of 1907 and inducing jittery depositors to withdraw funds from other banks.</p>
                    <p>On December 12, Columbia University hosted a lecture by British economist John Maynard Keynes, who discussed the recent recession and potential responses. Frightened by the bank collapse, Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt, attended the event to see his acquaintance from the peace negotiations. The two would catch up and promise to talk to each other more.</p>
                    <p>By the end of 1930, only 112.7 billion labor hours were recorded, representing a decline of 6.4% from the previous year. The Gross Domestic Product fell to 92.16 billion 1929 dollars. <span class="footnote" data-footnote="This isn’t quite true as there were not expectations of deflation as there usually aren’t under a gold standard. Realized real rates were high which hurt borrowers, but they wouldn’t know it at the time. Commodity prices for example were expected to increase in futures markets, see <a href='https://www.jstor.org/stable/2117608'>Hamilton 1992</a>, whereas they actually decreased. Other prices such as of new home sales should adjust immediately to beliefs about future prices but that too declined over time.">Prices had fallen 6% and were expected to drop further, raising the real return on cash to 6.4% and the real discount rate to 8.4%, well above the pre-depression real rates of 5-6%.</span> This contractionary monetary policy would continue to depress spending and further the deflationary spiral. The Fed cut rates faster than it ever had before, and managed to outpace deflation until April but the deflationary pressure proved too strong and real rates would continuously increase for the next year.</p>
                    <p>One would expect that banks as owners of large sums of debt such as mortgages would benefit from the deflation due to its appreciation in real value but one must remember that bank deposits are liabilities owed to customers. Their assets and liabilities would both increase in value due to deflation, but waves of foreclosures would tilt the scale towards default. Seeing these risks and the strings of prior bank runs, depositors rushed to withdraw putting further pressure on banks. In response banks hoarded reserves by ceasing lending in an effort to stave off runs, reducing access to credit and worsening the economic situation. Radical action was needed, radical action that wouldn't come.</p>
